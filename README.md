For this Project 5000 ads for Data Scientist, Data Engineer and Software Engineer were respectively collected from indeed.com. After all 15000 ads were collected a classification algorithm was built.
The code for web scrapping or collection of data can be found in scrapping.py file. The classification algrithm can be found in classification.py file.
The classification was trained on 15000 ads collected and it was tested on different set of ads(for Data Science, Data Engineer, Software Engineer) collected seprately from indeed.com
Highest accuracy achieved was 83.5% with SVC grid, logistic Regression and Decession Tree.
